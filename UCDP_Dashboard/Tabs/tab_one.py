            This dashboard provides an interactive exploration of **global conflict patterns**

            The goal of this dashboard is to **analyze temporal, spatial, and categorical dimensions**
            of violent conflicts. By combining time-series trends, regional breakdowns,
            and geospatial visualizations, the dashboard helps reveal:
            
            - üìà Shifts in violence intensity over time  
            - ‚öîÔ∏è Differences between conflict types (state-based, non-state, one-sided)  
            - üåç Regional hotspots and concentration of conflict activity  
            - üìä Country-level comparisons and aggregate summaries

            Throughout this analysis, **deaths (best estimate)** serve as the **primary quantifying metric** for measuring
            the magnitude and impact of conflicts. Each visualization and comparison is based on the
            reported number of fatalities per event, allowing for consistent cross-country and
            temporal evaluation of violence intensity.
